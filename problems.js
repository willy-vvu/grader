		"statement":"<b>Problem:</b> Set xIsDivisibleByY to true if y is a factor of x. Thus, if x=4 and y=2, then you should set xIsDivisibleByY to true. Alternatively, if x=5 and y=2, then you should set xIsDivisibleByY to false. <br><br><b>Boolean Statements:</b> Recall that the boolean type refers to variables that can be either true or false. We can use the keywords true or false wherever we need a boolean, or we can use a boolean expression. For example, the boolean expression 5 > 3 is always true. Another expression, 5 == 3, is always false. Note that you need two equal signs to compare two numbers. Finally, the expression x != 5 (x does not equal to 5) may be true or false depending on what x is. For this problem, you will need the percent sign operator, also known as the java \"modulo\" operator, or simply the \"mod\" operator. The percent sign is the shift 5 character on your standard QWERTY keyboard. Note: this problem is solvable without an if statement, in the fashion of someBooleanVariable = x > y; <br><br><b>Notes:</b> You do not need to print your output. Simply set the variables",
